## About ##

TheProfile is a multiuser online identity management software, designed to allow users to import profile data from a number of sources in to a single manageable profile. Profile data can then be exported via openID or the provided API's for use wherever the user may wish.

This software is only required if you wish to maintain your own copy of theProfile. If you simply want to use the software for your own profile you can just register an account on an existing installation such as www.theprofile.co.uk.
